Reactive Array for Meteor
=========================

This package provides a wrapper around the Array class to make it reactive. That means you can put your array inside a Tracker.autorun or a template helper and your app will be updated when items are added or removed from the array.

Install:
--------
meteor add manuel:reactivearray
